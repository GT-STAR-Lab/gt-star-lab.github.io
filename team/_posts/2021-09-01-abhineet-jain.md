I am an MS in CS student at Georgia Tech, currently working on learning dexterous manipulation from demonstrations with [Prof. Harish Ravichandar](https://harishravichandar.com/).

Before joining Georgia Tech, I was a Software Engineer at [Indeed](https://indeed.com/) for 4 years. I worked on Indeed Apply, a platform that creates and delivers millions of job applications to employers worldwide everyday.

I graduated from IIIT Hyderabad in 2017 with a Bachelors (Hons.) in Computer Science and Engineering, a class rank of 2 and a gold medal for being the Best All-rounder. During my last two years there, I worked at the [Robotics Research Center](http://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) with [Prof. K Madhava Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ) on a few projects.

In the summer of 2016, I worked as a Visiting Scholar with [Prof. Gaurav Sukhatme](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lRUi-A8AAAAJ) at [Robotics Embedded Systems Laboratory](http://robotics.usc.edu/resl) in the University of Southern California on learning robot affordances.
