I am a Robotics Ph.D. student. My research interests span the domains of robot learning, multi-robot systems, and human-robot interaction. My vision is to enable robots that are self-sufficient, yet can perform diverse tasks, learn new behaviors, and collaborate as a team, all with minimal expert guidance. In line with this vision, my dissertation focuses on developing learning algorithms that can learn efficiently and generalize well for complex multi-robot teaming domains. Alongside my passion for robotics, I love rock climbing, reading books, and spending lots of time with friends!
