I am a 1st year Robotics Ph.D. student. My research interests are in the intersection of robotics, AI, and control systems. Specifically, exploring robot learning methods to enable robots to operate in dynamic, complex environments, especially environments involving interaction with humans. I am also passionate about STEM outreach and education!
