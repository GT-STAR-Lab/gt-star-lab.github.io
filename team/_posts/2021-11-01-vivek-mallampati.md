I am a first-year student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, pursuing MS in Robotics. I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science where I developed robotic systems for a teleoperated nursing robot. I am interested in working on learning algorithms and developing middleware for autonomous robotic systems.
