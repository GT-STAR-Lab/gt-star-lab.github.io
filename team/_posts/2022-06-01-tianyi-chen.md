Hi! I’m Tianyi, a CS and ME undergraduate student minor in Robotics at Georgia Tech. My current research interests cover various topics in robotics, including learning for contact-rich and dexterous manipulation. When I’m not doing research, I’m interested in designing and building different kinds of electronics and mechatronics systems.
