Hey, this is Sayan! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the STAR lab in Georgia Tech. I am working on learning generalizable architectures for training multi-robot systems to learn from expert demonstrations. In simpler words, I look forward to making a team of robots with different features perform a task shown to them by some experts and extend the learnt knowledge to different scenarios. 

I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in 2020. During my undergrad, I worked in various fields in the application of machine learning, such as vision, NLP, and robotics. 

Other than research, I like travelling and writing blogs.
