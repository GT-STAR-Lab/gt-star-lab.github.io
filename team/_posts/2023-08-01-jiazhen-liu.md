My name is Jiazhen Liu and I am a Robotics PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Harish Ravichandar. My research mainly focuses on robust, trust-worthy, and scalable multi-robot systems. I am honored to be awarded the Georgia Robotics Fellowship in the School of Interactive Computing. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I received my M.S. in Computer and Information Science from University of Pennsylvania, and my B.E. in Computer Science from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.
