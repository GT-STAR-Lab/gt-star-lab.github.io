My name is Hanyao Guo and I am an MS Robotics student in Georgia Tech. My research focuses on linear dynamical system identification and robust Koopman learning algorithms. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I received my B.E. in Intelligence Science and Technology from Fudan University in 2023.

In my spare time, I love cooking, hiking, and watching sports games.
