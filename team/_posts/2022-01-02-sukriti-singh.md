Hey! I am an electrical engineer interested in Control Systems. It's fascinating how ML is weaving into this domain and this is exactly what I am exploring at Georgia Tech. I started my Masters here in Fall 2021 after an insightful industry experience of three years in India.

When I am not on my computer, I am mostly out for a run, a trek or finding hidden cafes to read.
