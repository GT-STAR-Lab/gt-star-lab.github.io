I am an MSCS student at GATech, and I am currently working on human-robot interaction with human-human demonstrations. In general, I'm curious about robot learning techniques that allow robots to coexist and cooperate with humans. Prior to Georgia Tech, I earned a BSc in Computer Science(Hons) from University College London.
