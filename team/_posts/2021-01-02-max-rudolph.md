Max moved on to UT Austin to pursue his PhD!

Hey! Iâ€™m Max, a second year robotics graduate student at Georgia Tech. My research focuses on teaching robots how to control and coordinate themselves. I use deep reinforcement learning to teach teams of heterogeneous robots to coordinate themselves and quadrupedal robots how to navigate in real-world environments. I graduated from Georgia Tech in May 2020 with a degree in electrical engineering and a minor in robotics.
