Kevin is an MS Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, as a part of Tech's BS/MS program. During his time as an undergraduate, he was heavily involved in GT's RoboCup team, which gave him a lasting interest in multi-agent coordination and an appreciation of the challenges involved. Currently he is exploring deep-learning-based coordination for heterogeneous robots.
