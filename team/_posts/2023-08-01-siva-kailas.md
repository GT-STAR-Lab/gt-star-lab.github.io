My name is Siva Kailas and I am a Robotics PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, co-advised under Prof. Harish Ravichandar and Prof. Dhruv Batra. My research focus at Georgia Tech is about generalizability in multi-agent embodied learning. I received the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in 2023. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I received my M.S. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute (School of Computer Science) in 2023. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Arizona State University (School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering) in 2020. I worked at Amazon.com Incorporated as a Software Development Engineer from 2020 - 2021.
