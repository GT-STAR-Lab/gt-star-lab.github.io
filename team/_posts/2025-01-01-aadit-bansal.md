I'm Aadit Bansal, an undergrad student at Georgia Tech completing a major in Computer Science, with threads in Devices and Intelligence, and a minor in Robotics. I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence and its applications in Robotics, but am still figuring out what I want to work on more specifically. Currently I'm looking into multi-robot systems and imitation learning for robots.
