My name is Zhenyang Chen and I am a Robotics M.S. student at Georgia Institute of Technology. Controlling complicated dynamical system is one of the most beautiful things in the nature, especially in scenarios that we have everyday like manipulation of objects and locomotion with legs. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I got my bachelor degree in robotics engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology in 2022 and studying at MIT in my senior year. Outside class and lab, I enjoy mountain Biking, racing drones, hiking, chatting with people about technology and all other aspects of the world.
