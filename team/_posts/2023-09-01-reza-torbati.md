I am a computer science masters student graduating in December of 2023 specializing in computational perception and robotics. I am interested in designing algorithms that allow real-world robots to move autonomously throughout the world. My current research involves multi-robot coordination algorithms where I am helping implement our algorithms on real-world robots.
