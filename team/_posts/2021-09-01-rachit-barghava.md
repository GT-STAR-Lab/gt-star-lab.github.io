Hi, I am Rachit! I recently graduated with a major in Computer Science and I am currently a Masters student, specializing in Machine Learning and Interactive Intelligence, at Georgia Tech. I have been working with [Dr. Harish Ravichandar](https://harishravichandar.com/) on learning from suboptimal demonstrations for multi-agent task assignment problem since 2020. Prior to that, I was a part of TerraBots VIP research team where we were working on autonomous robots for construction sites. At Georgia Tech, I have been a TA for Introduction to Robotics & Perception since 2019 and have also been a part of Medical Robotics club since the beginning of 2021. I will be graduating with my Masters in May 2022 and will be joining Google shortly after. If you happen to see me around campus, be sure to give a high five! ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/google-medium/1f642.png)
