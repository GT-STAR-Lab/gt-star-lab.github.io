## Abstract

Useful simulation of complex systems for real-time or otherwise computationally constrained applications often requires the creation of simplified system models from existing analytical models and data. In this work, the creation of candidate models through machine learning and heuristic-informed model simplification methods are explored, and the resulting candidate models are evaluated and compared through an optimal experiment design process. The dynamic system of interest is a counterflow air-to-water heat exchanger.
