## Abstract

Complex manipulation tasks often require non-trivial and coordinated movements of different parts of a robot. In this work, we address the challenges associated with learning and reproducing the skills required to execute such complex tasks. Specifically, we decompose a task into multiple subtasks and learn to reproduce the subtasks by learning stable policies from demonstrations. By leveraging the RMPflow framework for motion generation, our approach finds a stable global policy in the configuration space that enables simultaneous execution of various learned subtasks. The resulting global policy is a weighted combination of the learned policies such that the motions are coordinated and feasible under the robotâ€™s kinematic and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the necessity and efficacy of the proposed approach in the context of multiple constrained manipulation tasks performed by a Franka Emika robot.
