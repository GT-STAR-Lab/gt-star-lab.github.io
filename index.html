        The Structured Techniques for Algorithmic Robotics (STAR) Lab at <a class="off" href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, directed by <a href={{"/team/harish-ravichandar/" | absolute_url}}>Harish Ravichandar</a>, develops structured algorithms that help collaborative robots learn to reliably operate in complex environments, while leveraging and enhancing their interactions with humans. We study three distinct, yet connected, areas: <b>robot learning</b>, <b>human-robot interaction</b>, and <b>multi-agent coordination</b>. The lab is affliated with the <a class="off" href="http://robotics.gatech.edu/">Institute for Intelligent Robots and Machines (IRIM)</a>.

	<u>Want to get involved?</u>: We are looking to recruit both graduate and undergraduate students to work on exciting projects in robot learning, human-robot interaction, and multi-agent systems. If you are interested, we request that you take the time to read some of <a href={{ "/papers/" | absolute_url }}>our recent papers</a> to get a better sense of our research interests before contacting us. You can also watch Harish's recent short talk that provides a high-level overview of our research (see below). When you reach out, please share the specific research questions that excite you and why you want to investigate them at our lab in particular.
